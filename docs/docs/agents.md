# Agents

A OpenNLU agent is a virtual agent that handles conversations with your end-users. It is a natural language understanding module that understands the nuances of human language. OpenNLU translates end-user text during a conversation to structured data that your apps and services can understand. You design and build a OpenNLU agent to handle the types of conversations required for your system.

A OpenNLU agent is similar to a human call center agent. You train them both to handle expected conversation scenarios, and your training does not need to be overly explicit.
